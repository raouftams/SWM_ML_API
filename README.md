# SWM_ML_API

This api is created to analyse data related to the operation of collection and transportation of solid waste in algiers, Algeria. The main fonctionnalities of this api are loading data from database, filter and enrich data, extract useful information for decision making and apply machine learning for prediction and other analysis.

The machine learning part of this api is responsible for:
- Making prediction on the generation of solid waste using multiple algorithms like LSTM, GBRT and MLP.
- Detect anomalies in time series with isolation forest algorithm. 
- Time series clustering using Kmeans and DTW metric to calculate distances.

*Ther is only code in this repository because the data used in this project is confidential*
